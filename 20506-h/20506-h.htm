<h2><a name="PREFACE" id="PREFACE"></a>PREFACE.</h2>
<hr style="width: 5em;" />

<p>Euchre is played in so many different
ways and under so many different rules
that there seems to be a necessity for
more rigid and exact Laws than exist
at present.</p>

<p>The Laws of Euchre, as here appended,
have stood the test of time and received
the attention of many scientific Euchre-players.</p>

<p>If any game of cards is worth playing at
all, it should be played according to rule
in the strictest interpretation, and no favors
should be given or expected.</p>

<p><a name="Page_iv" id="Page_iv"></a><span class="pagenum" title="iv"></span>An attempt has been made in these
Rules to make the penalties commensurate
with the advantage which <em>might</em> be gained
by the error. A common instance of this
is in the case of a lead out of turn. It
often happens that the exposed card is an
advantage to the side so offending, and
the adversaries have no redress. Here the
Whist Law has been applied, allowing the
non-offending side the option of two penalties.
See Rule 52.</p>

<p>Another instance occurs in a lone hand.
An exposed card can only benefit the
adversaries, consequently no penalty is
attached; but should the lone hand lead
out of turn, he is supposed to be attempting
to gain an advantage, therefore Rule
104 has been adopted.</p>

<h2><a name="THE_LAWS_OF_EUCHRE" id="THE_LAWS_OF_EUCHRE"></a>THE LAWS OF EUCHRE.</h2>
<hr style="width: 5em;" />


<h3><a name="THE_RUBBER" id="THE_RUBBER"></a>THE RUBBER.</h3>

<p>1. The rubber is the best of three
games. If the first two games are won by
the same players, the third game is played;
should the score of the third game lap, a
fourth game is played.</p>


<h3><a name="SCORING" id="SCORING"></a>SCORING.</h3>

<p>2. A game consists of five points.
Should a player order up, assist, adopt, or
make the trump, and he and his partner
take five tricks, they score two; three or
<a name="Page_8" id="Page_8"></a><span class="pagenum" title="8"></span>four tricks, they score one. If they fail to
take three tricks they are euchred, and the
adversaries score two.</p>

<p>3. When a player plays alone and takes
five tricks, he scores four; three or four
tricks, he scores one. If he fails to take
three tricks he is euchred, and the adversaries
score four.</p>

<p>4. The penalty of a revoke takes precedence
of all other scores.</p>

<p>5. An error in the score can be rectified
at any time before the trump card is turned
in the next deal.</p>

<p>6. Points should be announced before
scoring.</p>

<p>7. Each game won counts one unless
the losing side has failed to score, in which
case the game counts two. Two additional
points are taken by the side winning
the rubber. Thus it is possible to win ten
<a name="Page_9" id="Page_9"></a><span class="pagenum" title="9"></span>points in a rubber; that is, four double
games, and two points for the rubber.</p>


<h3><a name="CUTTING" id="CUTTING"></a>CUTTING.</h3>

<p>8. The knave is the highest card, then
the ace, king, etc.</p>

<p>9. In all cases every one must cut from
the same pack.</p>

<p>10. Should a player expose more than
one card, he must cut again.</p>


<h3><a name="FORMATION" id="FORMATION">FORMATION OF THE TABLE.</a></h3>

<p>11. If there are more than four candidates,
the players are selected by cutting;
those first in the room having the preference.
The four who cut the highest cards
play first, and again cut to decide on partners.
The two highest play against the two
lowest. The highest is the dealer, who
has choice of cards, seats, and counters;
<a name="Page_10" id="Page_10"></a><span class="pagenum" title="10"></span>and having once made his selection, he
must abide by it.</p>

<p>12. When there are more than six candidates,
those who cut the fifth and sixth
highest cards belong to the table.</p>


<h3><a name="CUTTING_CARDS" id="CUTTING_CARDS"></a>CUTTING CARDS OF EQUAL VALUE.</h3>

<p>13. Two players cutting cards of equal
value, unless such cards are the two lowest,
or the two highest, cut again.</p>

<p>14. Three players cutting cards of equal
value, cut again; should the fourth (or
remaining) card be the highest, the two
lowest of the new cut are partners, and
their opponents have the deal. Should the
fourth card be the lowest, the two highest
of the new cut are partners, and have the
deal and choice of seats, etc.</p>


<h3><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11"></a><span class="pagenum" title="11"></span><a name="CUTTING_OUT" id="CUTTING_OUT"></a>CUTTING OUT.</h3>

<p>15. At the end of a rubber, should admission
be claimed by any one, or by two
candidates, he who has, or they who have,
played a greater number of consecutive
rubbers than the others, is or are out.
When all have played the same number,
they must cut to decide on the out-goers,
the lowest going out.</p>


<h3><a name="ENTRY" id="ENTRY"></a>ENTRY AND RE-ENTRY.</h3>

<p>16. A candidate wishing to enter a table
must declare such intention before any of
the players have cut a card, either for the
purpose of commencing a new rubber, or
of cutting out.</p>

<p>17. In the formation of fresh tables,
those candidates who have neither belonged
to nor played at any other table, have the
<a name="Page_12" id="Page_12"></a><span class="pagenum" title="12"></span>prior right of entry; the others decide
their right of admission by cutting.</p>

<p>18. Any one quitting a table prior to the
conclusion of a rubber may, with the consent
of the other three players, appoint a
substitute in his absence during that rubber.</p>

<p>19. Should a player leave a full table
after he has played but one of the two
consecutive rubbers to which he is entitled,
the candidate next in order for entrance to
the table takes his place, but must go out
at the end of one rubber, as his predecessor
would have done.</p>

<p>20. A player cutting into one table
while belonging to another, loses his right
of re-entry into the latter, and takes his
chance of cutting in as if he were a fresh
candidate.</p>

<p>21. If any one break up a table, the remaining
players have the prior right to
<a name="Page_13" id="Page_13"></a><span class="pagenum" title="13"></span>him of entry into any other; and should
there not be vacancies at such other table
for all those candidates, they settle their
precedence by cutting.</p>


<h3><a name="SHUFFLING" id="SHUFFLING"></a>SHUFFLING.</h3>

<p>22. The pack must neither be shuffled
below the table, nor so that the face of
any card can be seen.</p>

<p>23. The pack must not be shuffled during
the play of a hand.</p>

<p>24. Each player has a right to shuffle
once only, except as provided by Law 27,
prior to a deal, after a false cut, or when
a new deal has occurred.</p>

<p>25. The dealer's partner must collect
the cards for the ensuing deal, and he
has the first right to shuffle that pack.</p>

<p>26. Each player, after shuffling, must
place the cards, properly collected and face
<a name="Page_14" id="Page_14"></a><span class="pagenum" title="14"></span>downwards, to the left of the player about
to deal.</p>

<p>27. The dealer has always the right to
shuffle last; but should a card or cards be
seen during his shuffling or while giving
the pack to be cut, he may be compelled
to re-shuffle.</p>


<h3><a name="THE_DEAL" id="THE_DEAL"></a>THE DEAL.</h3>

<p>28. Each player deals in turn; the right
of dealing goes to the left.</p>

<p>29. The player on the dealer's right
cuts the pack, and in dividing it he must
not leave fewer than four cards in either
packet. If in cutting or in placing one of
the packets on the other, a card be exposed,
or if there be any confusion of the
cards, or a doubt as to the exact place
where the pack was divided, there must
be a fresh cut.</p>

<p><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15"></a><span class="pagenum" title="15"></span>30. When a player has once separated
a pack he cannot alter his intention; he
can neither re-shuffle nor re-cut the cards.</p>

<p>31. When the pack is cut, should the
dealer re-shuffle he loses the deal.</p>

<p>32. After dealing, the dealer should
put the pack at his right hand.</p>


<h3><a name="A_NEW_DEAL" id="A_NEW_DEAL"></a>A NEW DEAL.</h3>

<p>33. There must be a new deal by the
same dealer if during the deal or during
the play of the hand the pack be found
to be incorrect or imperfect; but all points
scored on previous hands stand.</p>

<p>34. If any card be found faced in the
pack before a lead is made, there must be
a new deal.</p>

<p>35. If, while dealing, a card be exposed
by the dealer or his partner, the adversaries
can call for a new deal, provided that
<a name="Page_16" id="Page_16"></a><span class="pagenum" title="16"></span>neither of them has touched the cards. A
card exposed by either adversary gives
that claim to the dealer, provided that his
partner has not touched the cards. If a
new deal does not take place, the exposed
card cannot be called.</p>

<p>36. If, during the deal, a player touch
any of his cards, the adversaries may do
the same without losing their privilege of
claiming a new deal, should chance give
them such option.</p>

<p>37. If, in dealing, one of the last cards
be exposed, and the dealer turn up the
trump before there is reasonable time for
his adversaries to decide as to a fresh deal,
they do not thereby lose their privilege.</p>

<p>38. A deal made with the adversaries'
cards is good, provided that the trump
card has been turned. If not, a new deal
may be claimed. The players thus losing
<a name="Page_17" id="Page_17"></a><span class="pagenum" title="17"></span>their cards may reclaim them at the end
of the deal.</p>

<p>39. Should the dealer, in turning the
trump card, expose any other card of the
pack, there must be a new deal.</p>

<p>40. A deal out of turn can be stopped,
if the error be discovered before the trump
card is turned; otherwise the deal stands.</p>


<h3><a name="A_MISDEAL" id="A_MISDEAL"></a>A MISDEAL.</h3>

<p>41. A misdeal loses the deal.</p>

<p>42. It is a misdeal,&mdash;</p>

<p>I. Unless five cards are dealt to
each player.</p>

<p>II. Unless the dealer begin by giving
two cards to each player in turn
in the first round of the deal, and three
in the second, or <em>vice versa</em>.</p>

<p>43. A misdeal does not lose the deal
if during the dealing either of the adversaries
<a name="Page_18" id="Page_18"></a><span class="pagenum" title="18"></span>touch the cards prior to the dealer's
partner having done so. Should the latter
have first interfered with the cards, notwithstanding
either or both of the adversaries
have subsequently done the same,
the deal is lost.</p>

<p>44. If the adversaries interrupt a dealer
while dealing, either by questioning the
score or asserting that it is not his deal,
and fail to establish such claim, should a
misdeal occur he may deal again.</p>

<p>45. Should a player take his partner's
deal and misdeal, the latter is liable to
the usual penalties, and the adversary next
in rotation to the player who ought to
have dealt, then deals.</p>


<h3><a name="CARDS_LIABLE" id="CARDS_LIABLE"></a>CARDS LIABLE TO BE CALLED.</h3>

<p>46. All exposed cards are liable to be
called, and must be left on the table; but a
<a name="Page_19" id="Page_19"></a><span class="pagenum" title="19"></span>card is not an exposed card when dropped
on the floor or elsewhere below the table.</p>

<p>The following are exposed cards:&mdash;</p>

<p>I. Two or more cards played at once.</p>

<p>II. Any card dropped face upwards,
or in any way exposed on or above
the table, even though snatched up so
quickly that no one can name it.</p>

<p>III. The trump card if lifted from
the pack.</p>

<p>47. If any one play to an imperfect trick
the highest card on the table, or lead one
which is a winning card against his adversaries,
and then lead again, or play
several such winning cards one after the
other, without waiting for his partner to
play, the latter may be called on to win,
if he can, the first or any other of those
tricks, and the other cards thus improperly
played are exposed cards.</p>

<p><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20"></a><span class="pagenum" title="20"></span>48. If a player or players, under the
impression that the game is lost or won,
or for other reasons, throw his or their
cards on the table face upwards, such
cards are exposed, and can be called, each
player's by the adversary; but should
one player retain his hand, he cannot be
forced to abandon it.</p>

<p>49. If all four players throw their cards
on the table face upwards, the hands are
abandoned, and no one can again take up
his cards. Should it then be proved that
the game could have been saved or won,
no such claim can be entertained unless
a revoke be established.</p>

<p>50. In a lone hand, should either adversary
abandon his hand by laying it face
upwards on the table, or by failing to
play to every trick, the party playing alone
scores five points.</p>

<p><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21"></a><span class="pagenum" title="21"></span>51. A card detached from the rest of
the hand is liable to be called if either
of the adversaries can name it; but should
an adversary name a wrong card, he is
liable to have a suit called when he or
his partner next lead.</p>

<p>52. If any player lead out of turn, the
adversaries may either call the card erroneously
led, or may call a suit from him
or his partner when it is next the turn of
either to lead.</p>

<p>53. If any player lead out of turn, and
the other three have followed him, the
trick is complete, and the error cannot be
rectified; but if only the second, or the
second and third, have played to the false
lead, their cards, on discovery of the mistake,
are taken back, and there is no
penalty against any one except the original
offender.</p>

<p><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22"></a><span class="pagenum" title="22"></span>54. If a player who has rendered himself
liable to have his highest or lowest
called, fail to play as desired, or if when
called on to lead one suit, lead another,
having in his hand one or more cards of
the suit demanded, he incurs the penalty
of a revoke.</p>

<p>55. In no case can a player be compelled
to play a card which would oblige
him to revoke.</p>

<p>56. The call for an exposed card can
be repeated until such card has been
played.</p>

<p>57. If a player called on to lead a suit
have none of it, the penalty is paid.</p>


<h3><a name="CARDS_PLAYED" id="CARDS_PLAYED"></a>CARDS PLAYED IN ERROR.</h3>

<p>58. Should the third hand play before
the second, the fourth may play before his
partner.</p>

<p><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23"></a><span class="pagenum" title="23"></span>59. Should the third hand not have
played, and the fourth hand play before
his partner, the latter may be called on
to win or lose the trick.</p>

<p>60. Should any one have omitted playing
to a former trick, and such error be not
discovered till he has played to the next,
the adversaries may claim a new deal.
Should they decide that the deal stand
good, the surplus card at the end of the
hand is considered to have been played to
the imperfect trick, but does not constitute
a revoke therein.</p>

<p>61. If any one play two cards to the
same trick, or mix his trump or other
card with a trick to which it does not
properly belong, and the mistake is not
discovered till the hand is played out,
he is answerable for all the consequent
revokes he may have made.</p>

<p><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24"></a><span class="pagenum" title="24"></span>If during the play of the hand the error
be detected, the tricks may be counted face
downwards, to ascertain if there be among
them a card too many; should this be the
case, the trick may be searched, and the
card restored. The player is, however,
liable for all the revokes he may have
meanwhile made.</p>


<h3><a name="THE_REVOKE" id="THE_REVOKE"></a>THE REVOKE.</h3>

<p>62. Is when a player, holding one or
more cards of the suit led, plays a card of
a different suit.</p>

<p>63. The penalty of a revoke is three
points, except in the case of a lone hand,
when it is five; and the penalty may be
claimed as often as the revoke is repeated
in the hand.</p>

<p>64. A revoke is established if the trick
in which it occurs be turned and quitted;
<a name="Page_25" id="Page_25"></a><span class="pagenum" title="25"></span>or if the revoking player or his partner,
whether in his right turn or otherwise,
lead or play to the following trick.</p>

<p>65. A player may ask his partner
whether he has not a card of the suit
renounced. Should the question be asked
before the trick be turned and quitted,
subsequent turning and quitting does not
establish the revoke, and the error may
be corrected, unless the question be answered
in the negative, or unless the revoking
player or his partner have led or
played to the following trick.</p>

<p>66. At the end of the hand the claimants
of a revoke may search all the tricks.</p>

<p>67. Should a revoke be claimed, and the
accused player or his partner mix the
cards before they have been sufficiently
examined by the adversaries, the revoke
is established.</p>

<p><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26"></a><span class="pagenum" title="26"></span>68. A revoke cannot be claimed after
the cards are cut for the next deal.</p>

<p>69. If a player discover his mistake in
time to save a revoke, the adversaries
may call the card played in error. Any
player or players who have played after
him, except his partner, may withdraw
their cards and substitute others; the
cards so withdrawn are not liable to be
called.</p>

<p>70. A revoking player and his partner
may require the hand on which the revoke
occurred to be played out.</p>

<p>71. An equal number of revokes on
different sides cancel each other.</p>


<h3><a name="CALLING" id="CALLING"></a>CALLING FOR NEW CARDS.</h3>

<p>72. Any player (on paying for them)
before, but not after, the pack is cut for
the deal, may call for fresh cards. He must
<a name="Page_27" id="Page_27"></a><span class="pagenum" title="27"></span>call for two new packs, of which the dealer
has the choice.</p>

<p>73. A card or cards torn or marked must
be replaced by agreement, or new cards
called for at the expense of the table.</p>


<h3><a name="MAKING_THE_TRUMP" id="MAKING_THE_TRUMP"></a>MAKING THE TRUMP AND PLAYING.</h3>

<p>74. The trump card having been turned,
the eldest hand may pass, order up, or play
alone; in either of the last two cases the
third hand may take it from him and play
alone.</p>

<p>75. Should the eldest hand pass, the
second hand may pass, assist, or play
alone; in either of the last two cases the
dealer may take it from him and play alone.</p>

<p>76. Should the second hand pass, the
third hand can pass, order up, or play
alone; and after him the dealer must pass,
take up the trump, or play alone.</p>

<p><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28"></a><span class="pagenum" title="28"></span>77. Should all four players pass, the
trump is turned down, and the first hand
can name a suit, or pass; and so on in turn
around the table. Should all pass again, the
deal is at an end, and the next player deals.</p>

<p>78. Should the player entitled to make
a trump name a suit, he cannot change;
and should he name the suit turned down,
he is considered to have passed.</p>

<p>79. Should the player, after naming the
suit turned down, or passing, mention the
suit he intended to make trumps, his partner
also must pass.</p>

<p>80. Should a player pass, and then attempt
to assist, or order up the trump, his
partner also must pass. The adversaries,
however, may elect that it shall be played.</p>

<p>81. Should a player make a declaration,
and his partner not hear it and pass, the
declaration is not invalidated.</p>

<p><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29"></a><span class="pagenum" title="29"></span>82. No player can take away another's
right by passing, ordering up, or assisting,
out of turn; but should the dealer turn
down the trump card, or on the second
round throw his cards on the table, such
action is binding on his partner.</p>

<p>83. If any one, prior to his partner's
playing, should call attention to the trick
either by saying that it is or is not his, or
by naming his card or by drawing it without
being asked to do so, or call on his partner
to take or not to take the trick, the adversaries
may require that opponent's partner
to play his highest or lowest of the
suit led, or to win or lose the trick.</p>

<p>84. A player has no right to ask who
played a particular card, but at any time
during the play of a trick, or after the four
cards are played, but before they are
touched for the purpose of gathering them
<a name="Page_30" id="Page_30"></a><span class="pagenum" title="30"></span>together, may demand that the cards be
placed before their respective players.</p>

<p>85. When a player and his partner have
an option of exacting from their adversaries
one of two penalties, they should agree who
is to make the election, but must not
consult with one another which of the two
penalties it is advisable to exact. If they
do so consult, they lose their right; and
if either of them, with or without the consent
of his partner, demand a penalty to
which he is entitled, such decision is final.</p>


<h3><a name="THE_DISCARD" id="THE_DISCARD"></a>THE DISCARD.</h3>

<p>86. Should the card turned up be made
the trump, the dealer must at once discard
one card from his hand. The discard is
not complete until the dealer has placed
the card under the pack and quitted it;
after which he cannot change.</p>

<p><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31"></a><span class="pagenum" title="31"></span>87. Should the eldest hand lead before
the discard is completed, the lead stands,
and the dealer can change his discard if
he wishes.</p>

<p>88. The trump card cannot be discarded.</p>

<p>89. Should the third hand play alone,
and the second player lead before the
dealer has discarded, the latter can be
called on to play his highest or lowest
of the suit led, or to win or lose the
trick.</p>

<p>90. Should any player have more or
less than five cards, or the dealer neglect
to discard before playing, the deal holds
good, and the party so offending forfeits
two if all four are playing, and four if a
lone hand is played. They also are not
entitled to score any point or points they
may have made on that hand.</p>


<h3><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32"></a><span class="pagenum" title="32"></span><a name="THE_TRUMP_CARD" id="THE_TRUMP_CARD"></a>THE TRUMP CARD.</h3>

<p>91. The trump card must be left in view
till played, and if removed or lifted from
the pack, becomes an exposed card.</p>

<p>92. After the trump card has been
played, no player has a right to ask what
card was turned up, but can at any time
ask what is the trump suit.</p>


<h3><a name="PLAYING_ALONE" id="PLAYING_ALONE"></a>PLAYING ALONE.</h3>

<p>93. A player may play alone when he
orders up, assists, adopts, or makes the
trump, or when his partner does so, provided
that he himself has not already
passed.</p>

<p>94. If a player declares to play alone,
his partner may take it from him, subject
to the previous rule; in which case the
form of declaration must be, &ldquo;I take it
from you.&rdquo;</p>

<p><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33"></a><span class="pagenum" title="33"></span>95. A player cannot play alone when he
or his partner is ordered up, or when his
adversaries adopt or make the trump, or
if before making his declaration he exposes
a card.</p>

<p>96. The dealer must announce his intention
to play alone before quitting his
discard.</p>

<p>97. A player must announce his intention
to play alone before naming the trump,
otherwise he can be required to play the
hand with his partner.</p>

<p>98. In all cases a single declaration
must be made. It is not permitted to say,
&ldquo;I order it up and play it alone,&rdquo; or &ldquo;I make
it hearts and play it alone.&rdquo; The declaration
must be, &ldquo;I play alone at hearts,&rdquo;
or, &ldquo;Alone at hearts.&rdquo; Any other declaration
precludes a lone hand.</p>

<p>99. Should the partner of the player
<a name="Page_34" id="Page_34"></a><span class="pagenum" title="34"></span>playing alone offer to take it from him
after a lead has been made, or after he has
himself passed, neither can play alone.</p>

<p>100. Should a player announce that he
will play alone, and his partner play upon
the first lead, the player loses his right to
play the hand alone, and must play it with
his partner, unless his adversaries elect
that he play it alone.</p>

<p>101. Should a player announce that he
will play alone, his partner must place his
own cards on the table face downwards, and
not again take them up. He shall have the
right to gather and quit his partner's tricks,
and his action is binding on his partner.</p>

<p>102. Should a player expose the face of
any of his cards, his partner can score only
two points, should he take every trick; but
in case of a euchre the adversaries score
four.</p>

<p><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35"></a><span class="pagenum" title="35"></span>103. After the partner of the lone player
has placed his hand on the table, either
adversary may count the hand, to see if it
contains more or less than five cards.</p>

<p>104. A player playing alone is liable to
no penalty for simply exposing a card; but
should he lead out of turn, the card is an
exposed card, and can be called.</p>

<p>105. Should an adversary play out of
turn to the lead of a lone hand, both
opposing hands must be laid on the table,
and can be called by the player playing
alone.</p>


<h3><a name="ETIQUETTE" id="ETIQUETTE"></a>ETIQUETTE OF EUCHRE.</h3>

<p>106. The following rules belong to the
established Etiquette of Euchre. They are
not called &ldquo;Laws,&rdquo; as it is difficult, and in
some cases impossible, to apply any penalty
to their infraction, and the only remedy is
<a name="Page_36" id="Page_36"></a><span class="pagenum" title="36"></span>to cease to play with the players who habitually
disregard them.</p>

<p>107. Two packs of cards of different
colors are invariably used at Clubs, and
this should be adhered to if possible.</p>

<p>108. A player having the lead and
another winning card to play, should not
draw the second card out of his hand till
his partner has played to the first trick,
such act being a distinct intimation that
the former has played a winning card.</p>

<p>109. No intimation whatever by word
or gesture should be given by a player as
to the state of the hand or the game after
the trump card is turned.</p>

<p>110. A player who desires the cards to
be placed, or demands to see the last trick,
should do so for his own information only,
and not to attract the attention of his
partner.</p>

<p><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37"></a><span class="pagenum" title="37"></span>111. No player should object to refer to
a bystander who professes himself uninterested
in the game and able to decide
any disputed question of fact.</p>

<p>112. It is unfair to revoke purposely;
and having made a revoke, a player is not
justified in making a second to conceal the
first.</p>

<p>113. Until the players have made such
bets as they wish, bets should not be made
with the bystanders.</p>

<p>114. Bystanders should make no remark,
nor should they, by word or gesture, give
any intimation of the state of the game
until concluded and scored, nor should
they walk around the table to look at the
different hands.</p>

<p>115. No one should look over the hand
of a player against whom he is betting.</p>

<p>116. Players should pass, assist, order
<a name="Page_38" id="Page_38"></a><span class="pagenum" title="38"></span>up, etc., with as nearly as possible the
same manner at all times, and should be
careful not to give information by unusual
quickness or delay.</p>


<h3><a name="TECHNICAL_TERMS" id="TECHNICAL_TERMS"></a>TECHNICAL TERMS USED IN EUCHRE.</h3>

<p>&ldquo;Right Bower,&rdquo; or &ldquo;Right,&rdquo;&mdash;knave of
the trump suit, which is the highest card.</p>

the same color as the trump suit, which is
the second best card.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Alone,&rdquo;&mdash;playing without your partner.</p>

carried to the next game.</p>

<p><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40"></a><span class="pagenum" title="40"></span>&ldquo;Rubber,&rdquo;&mdash;consists of three games.</p>

<p>When, however, a lap is made in the
third game, a fourth must be played.</p>

<p>A &ldquo;Lay Card,&rdquo; or an &ldquo;Outsider,&rdquo;&mdash;is
a card of a different suit from the trump.</p>

<h2><a name="GENERAL_REMARKS" id="GENERAL_REMARKS"></a>GENERAL REMARKS.</h2>
<hr style="width: 5em;" />

<p>The following points are written simply
for the information of those not thoroughly
conversant with the game of Euchre.</p>

<p>It is not the intention of the authors to
write a treatise on the game, but merely
to illustrate a few conventional plays, most
of which are in use among the best exponents
of the game.</p>

<p>There can be no absolute rules about
the play in Euchre, as in Whist, as the
number of cards is so few that the importance
of each play is intensified, and the
<a name="Page_42" id="Page_42"></a><span class="pagenum" title="42"></span>score has so great an influence on the
hand.</p>

<p>The exceptions also are perhaps almost
as numerous as the rules; but if the beginner
will accept as a guide the appended
hints, it is thought they will not lead him
far astray.</p>

<p>The play of the cards is governed by the
card sense of the individual.</p>

<p>The refinement of the game consists in
playing to the score, which is quite peculiar
to Euchre, since it is so constantly changing.
The same hand should suggest different
ideas at different scores.</p>

<p>A player should school himself to notice
the score before he picks up his hand.
No attempt has been made to go beyond
the adoption of the trump, passing, assisting,
and the original lead or play, at the
risk of being confusing.</p>

<p><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43"></a><span class="pagenum" title="43"></span>A beginner should follow these hints
pretty closely. A good Euchre player can
make his own exceptions; but they should
be made with careful consideration, and
not abused.</p>


<h3><a name="ELDEST" id="ELDEST"></a>ELDEST, OR FIRST HAND.</h3>

<p>When the right is not turned, order
with three medium trumps or better, and
some strength in suit, <em>provided you have
nothing to go to</em>; for example, ace, queen,
ten of the turn-up, and two cards of another
suit.</p>

<p>Do not order (unless with great strength)
if you can make it next; for example, queen
of clubs turned up, you hold right, ten, and
nine of clubs, and king and ten of spades;
or left, ace and seven of clubs, seven of
spades, and seven of diamonds. In both
of these cases pass, and make it next.</p>

<p><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44"></a><span class="pagenum" title="44"></span>Make it next when you can, and do not
cross the suit, unless very strong, especially
when a bower is turned down; for example,
the dealer has turned down the king of
spades, with ace, king, and seven of hearts,
knave of spades, and ten of clubs: make it
next, and lead the left.</p>

<p>When making the trump with ace and
two others (without the king), lead ace
in next, and small one when crossing the
suit.</p>

<p>If the right is not turned, lead trumps
through the assisting hand. The exceptions
to this are,&mdash;With left and small
one; ace and small one; with score four
to three in your favor, and you play with
certain reasons to stop a march; and occasionally
when short of a suit.</p>

<p>With a large tenace in trumps as right,
ace, or right, king, and no outside cards
<a name="Page_45" id="Page_45"></a><span class="pagenum" title="45"></span>of any special value, play an off-suit,
whether dealer takes up with or without
assistance.</p>

<p>With one or two trumps and two aces,
lead trumps, whether through assistance
or not.</p>

<p>If the dealer adopts the trump, avoid,
if you can, leading from suits of king,
seven; queen, seven, etc. If possible, lead
an ace, or from a short suit of king or
queen, or from a suit of equals, as king,
queen, or queen, knave, or knave, ten.</p>

<p>In general do not lead trumps up to the
dealer's adoption; but with three trumps,
and the score two points in your favor,
lead a trump, if the turn-up is not above
the king. If you hold the two bowers
and an outside ace, always lead them in
the order named.</p>

<p>Always lead a trump when your partner
<a name="Page_46" id="Page_46"></a><span class="pagenum" title="46"></span>has ordered up, or made the trump. If
you have no trump, play your best card.
Avoid leading the turn-down until at least
one round of trumps has been played. If
you have left and small one, lead the
left and continue with small one if both
opponents follow. With any two others,
lead smallest, unless equals.</p>

<p>Score four to three in your favor is a
position of caution, and consequently your
play should be very conservative.</p>


<h3><a name="SECOND_HAND" id="SECOND_HAND"></a>SECOND HAND.</h3>

<p>Do not assist too light. This is the most
common error in Euchre.</p>

<p class="exampleh">Assist with three trumps.</p>

<p class="example">right and another.<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a></p>
<p class="example">left and another, and outside ace.</p>
<p class="exampleh"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47"></a><span class="pagenum" title="47"></span>Assist with left and another; dependent
upon the score,</p>

<p class="example">two trumps and two aces.</p>

<p class="example">ace and another, and outside
ace; dependent upon
score; always, however, if
right is turned.</p>

<p class="example">two medium trumps, and one
suit of three, headed by the
ace, dependent upon the
score.</p>

<p>Ace and another, and king and another,
even when short of a suit, are permissible
only when justified by scores of four-all
or four-love in your favor.</p>

<p>Anything less than this is not good
Euchre, except, of course, at the two above-named
scores.</p>

<p>Do not assist the right with two small
ones. Your partner usually will know
<a name="Page_48" id="Page_48"></a><span class="pagenum" title="48"></span>what to do with the bower. By too light
an assistance you may tempt him into a
lone hand, under the impression that one
or two big trumps are out of his way.</p>

<p>Remember that to be short of one or two
suits is a great advantage to an assisting
hand.</p>

<p>When led through with right and another,
play the right, except when the ace is
turned,&mdash;when it is permissible to finesse.</p>

<p>When led through, when assisting with
left and another, play left, unless right or
ace is turned.</p>

<p>When assisting with three trumps, if
you take the first trick in suit, lead trumps
at once. If you take the first trick by
trumping a suit, your play is then dependent
upon the value of your remaining
trumps and the turn-up.</p>

<p>With two trumps and two aces, lead
<a name="Page_49" id="Page_49"></a><span class="pagenum" title="49"></span>trumps as early as possible, if your opponents
have not done so for you.</p>

<p>If your partner adopts the turn-up without
your assistance, and you hold queen,
seven; ten, eight, etc., in trumps, ruff as
early as possible with the big one, and lead
the small one.</p>

<p>If you take the first trick in suit, and
your partner throws away, do not lead the
suit he has shown, even if you have the
ace of it.</p>

<p>If your partner turn down black, make
it red if you can, especially if he has
turned down the bower.</p>

<p>When playing second to a small card,
do not ruff with right alone if it is the first
trick. Ruff with left alone, especially with
your partner's make or adoption.</p>

<p>If your partner refuses to adopt the
turn-up, and the third hand declares to
<a name="Page_50" id="Page_50"></a><span class="pagenum" title="50"></span>play alone, lead a card of the same suit
as the turn-down.</p>

<p>With one small trump, ruff as soon as
you can.</p>

<p>Do not finesse in lay cards.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_1_1" id="Footnote_1_1"></a><a href="#FNanchor_1_1" class="fnlabel">[1]</a> &ldquo;Another&rdquo; means &ldquo;a small one.&rdquo;</p>


<h3><a name="THIRD_HAND" id="THIRD_HAND"></a>THIRD HAND.</h3>

<p>It requires a stronger hand to order or
make the trump in this position than in
the eldest hand, since you cannot depend
upon your partner's lead, and he has displayed
weakness by passing.</p>

<p>However, if you have a good hand at the
turn-up, and are very strong at next, it is
better to order, since the stronger you are
at next, the greater the improbability that
your partner will be able to make it next.</p>

<p>It is wise to see your way absolutely
clear to three tricks before ordering the
right.</p>

<p><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51"></a><span class="pagenum" title="51"></span>There are certain hands, however, which
by their strength compel you to order,&mdash;the
right not being turned; and here are
most of them.</p>

<p class="exampleh">Order with four trumps.</p>

<p class="example">two bowers and another.</p>
<p class="example">two bowers and outside ace.</p>
<p class="example">three trumps and two aces.</p>
<p class="example">three trumps and one suit, headed by ace.</p>
<p class="example">right, ace, and another.</p>
<p class="example">left, ace, king, and outside ace.</p>
<p class="example">left, ace, king, and one suit.</p>
<p class="example">left, ace, king, dependent upon the score.</p>
<p class="example">left, king and another, and outside ace.</p>
<p class="example">left, queen and another, and outside ace.</p>

<p><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52"></a><span class="pagenum" title="52"></span>Order with ace, king and another, and
outside ace.</p>

<p>If you ruff, it is usually well to beat the
turn-up.</p>


<h3><a name="THE_DEALER" id="THE_DEALER"></a>THE DEALER.</h3>

<p class="exampleh">Take up three trumps.</p>
<p class="example">right and ace.</p>
<p class="example">right and king.</p>
<p class="example">right and queen.</p>
<p class="example">right and another, and one suit.</p>
<p class="example">right, another, and outside ace.</p>
<p class="example">left, ace, and outside ace.</p>
<p class="example">left, another, outside ace; and king, queen of the third suit.</p>
<p class="example">ace, king, and one suit headed by ace; dependent upon score.</p>
<p class="example">two trumps and two aces.</p>

<p>With the score at four-all or four-love
in his favor, the dealer may play a lighter
<a name="Page_53" id="Page_53"></a><span class="pagenum" title="53"></span>hand than any mentioned above, especially
if it is his best.</p>

<p>Scores of three-all and four to two in
dealer's favor require more than ordinary
caution.</p>

<p>With score four to three in dealer's
favor he may play a shade lighter than
ordinary.</p>

<p>If it comes round to the dealer to make
a trump, it is permissible to make it with
somewhat less strength than would be required
in the other three hands.</p>

<p>It is usually better with a fair hand to
try for a point rather than to turn down
for a euchre. If, however, the dealer is
better at next, and holds both bowers of the
cross-suit, it is good euchre to pass.</p>

<p>If the dealer adopts the turn-up without
assistance and has right and another, and
takes the first trick with his small trump,
<a name="Page_54" id="Page_54"></a><span class="pagenum" title="54"></span>he should not lead the right unless he can
follow with an ace.</p>

<p>Always be careful how you play your
small cards, and never play false cards.</p>

<p>If the dealer adopts the turn-up, he
should discard the lowest card of a
short suit; for example, with three trumps,
ace, seven of one suit, and outside king,
discard the king. Some prefer to keep
the king with score four-all with only
two trumps in the hand. With two
trumps (clubs), ace, seven of hearts, and
king, seven of diamonds, discard the seven
of diamonds.</p>

<p>With three trumps (clubs), ace, king of
hearts, and ace of diamonds, discard the
king of hearts, except when playing a lone
hand, in which case discard the ace of
diamonds.</p>

<p>When your partner assists, and you take
<a name="Page_55" id="Page_55"></a><span class="pagenum" title="55"></span>the first or second trick, always give him a
trump if he has not played one.</p>

<p>Give all the information possible to your
partner by your play; for example, queen of
clubs is turned up, and you are assisted and
hold the king of clubs in your hand. If
you or your partner take the first trick
with a trump, play the king. If you hold
both ace and king of clubs in your hand,
play the ace.</p>

<p>If you hold ace and king of an outside
suit, throw away the ace as soon as possible
on your partner's trick, thereby showing
him you have command of that suit.
If, however, you see by the fall of the cards
that your partner has no strength in his
hand, you may conceal this information,
since it will do him no good, and can only
benefit your opponents. This, of course,
applies to all four hands.</p>


<h3><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56"></a><span class="pagenum" title="56"></span><a name="THE_BRIDGE" id="THE_BRIDGE"></a>THE BRIDGE.</h3>

<p>There is such a variety of opinion about
the bridge that the writers do not feel confident
enough to express any decided view
about the matter.</p>

<p>It is a complicated question from a mathematical
point of view, and they have never
kept any record for a long enough period
of time to be of any practical value.</p>

<p>They doubt, however, the expediency of
keeping the bridge strictly.</p>

<p>If, however, the bridge is to be kept at
all, it should be kept always, and in the
same manner; otherwise you deceive your
partner.</p>

<p>There is a growing tendency to abolish
the bridge. The writers remember distinctly
not long ago when every one kept
the bridge; now the same players take their
<a name="Page_57" id="Page_57"></a><span class="pagenum" title="57"></span>chances with two lay aces, or the ace and
another in trumps. This, however, is purely
a matter of taste, and is not offered here as
an arbitrary rule.</p>

<p>Naturally, some hands will make four
beyond a doubt; but it is much harder to
get an imperfect lone hand through against
two good players than against two inferior
ones; hence the better the players, the less
is the value of the bridge against the ordinary
lone hand.</p>


<h3><a name="LONE_HANDS" id="LONE_HANDS"></a>LONE HANDS.</h3>

<p>It is impossible to absolutely define a
&ldquo;lone hand.&rdquo; With the score three-all, four-all,
or any score in your favor, do not risk
a light lone hand. It is our opinion that
a great many points are lost by not taking
your partner with you for a march.</p>

<p>With the score four-one or four-two
<a name="Page_58" id="Page_58"></a><span class="pagenum" title="58"></span>against you, you may take a desperate
chance.</p>

<p>If your opponents keep bridges tolerably
strictly, you must, of course, be more careful
if they have passed.</p>

<p>The eldest hand has the best position to
play a lone hand, and the dealer the next
best.</p>

<p>The second and third hands have the
weakest positions for lone hands, especially
the third hand, if the turn-up is the trump,
since if the third hand declares to play
alone it has become an established custom
for the dealer to discard next in suit, and
for his partner to lead it to him. The
third hand should take this into consideration
before playing alone. This is the
only case when the original lead of next in
suit has any significance.</p>

<p>In playing against a lone hand, you
<a name="Page_59" id="Page_59"></a><span class="pagenum" title="59"></span>should lead from a short suit or suit of
equals, if possible, and the fourth card you
play (supposing always the lone hand to
take the first four tricks with trumps)
should inform your partner what suit you
mean to keep. For example: Clubs are
trumps. Eldest hand has two small trumps,
queen of hearts, and queen and seven of
spades. Lead the queen of hearts. The
dealer, who is playing alone, ruffs the heart
and leads both bowers and the ace of trumps.
On the fourth trick you play the seven of
spades; your partner, holding the ace of
spades and the ten of diamonds, should
throw away the ace of spades and keep the
ten, thereby attacking the lone hand in all
three suits.</p>

<p>Example: Clubs are trumps. The eldest
hand has the king of clubs, the king of
hearts, the ace and seven of diamonds, and
<a name="Page_60" id="Page_60"></a><span class="pagenum" title="60"></span>the ten of spades. Lead the king of hearts,
throw away the ten of spades as early
as possible, and play the seven of diamonds
on the fourth trick, thereby informing
your partner that you are keeping
a diamond.</p>

<p>If you lead from equals,&mdash;as king,
queen, or queen, knave,&mdash;and your opponent
takes the trick with a card of that
suit, throw away all your other cards,
however high, and keep your second one
of that suit. This applies always against
the dealer, and usually against any other
player.</p>

<p>If the eldest hand holds the ace of hearts
and the ace and king of spades (the trump
being a club), lead the ace of hearts and
advertise the command of the spade suit
by throwing away the ace as soon as
possible.</p>

<p><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61"></a><span class="pagenum" title="61"></span>An exception: For third hand, supposing
the dealer to have taken the first three
tricks without showing a lay card and to
have led a winning trump for the fourth
trick. If your partner's fourth card is a
lay king, and you hold one card of that
suit and one of another, neither of which
suits has been ruffed, keep the card of the
same suit as your partner's king on the
fourth trick.</p>

<p>With an assistance you may play a lone
hand with less strength than otherwise.</p>

<p>Should your partner declare to play
alone, and you have a fair trump hand
with no weakness in lay suits, it is good
play to take it from him.</p>


<h3><a name="COUPS" id="COUPS"></a>COUPS.</h3>

<p>The following cases are offered to illustrate
some of the fine points in the
<a name="Page_62" id="Page_62"></a><span class="pagenum" title="62"></span>game. Opportunities for making some of
these plays occur frequently, and every
ambitious euchre-player should be familiar
with them. The easiest way to follow
them is to place the cards on the table as
shown below.</p>

<p>A coup is when you depart from the
ordinary established rules of play, with
certain reasons for each special case. Do
not hesitate when attempting a coup. Consider
what the play of your adversaries
means, as well as that of your partner.</p>

<p>Bear in mind that coups are justified
only in exceptional cases.</p>

<p>In all these cases A and C are partners.
A is the dealer, and the discard is supposed
to have been properly made.</p>


<h3><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63"></a><span class="pagenum" title="63"></span><a name="CASE_I" id="CASE_I"></a>CASE I.</h3>

</div>
</div>

<p>Score, love-all. A adopts the trump.</p>

<p><em>First Trick.</em>&mdash;B leads knave of diamonds,
C plays the seven, D ruffs with the
ten of clubs, and A throws away the eight
of spades.</p>

<p><em>Second Trick.</em>&mdash;D leads the ace of spades,
A ruffs with the nine of clubs, and both B
and C follow suit.</p>

<p><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64"></a><span class="pagenum" title="64"></span><em>Third Trick.</em>&mdash;A leads the right bower
and catches the ace and king from B and
D, while his partner throws his small
diamond.</p>

<p><em>Fourth Trick.</em>&mdash;in this case A will win
whether he leads the ace or king of hearts;
but his play should be the king, since his
partner cannot help him in any way, and
B might hold the left bower and pass
the king of hearts, when he would ruff the
ace.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Remarks.</span>&mdash;If A goes over the ten of
trumps with his right in the first trick,
he will be euchred. This is the simplest
coup, and is in constant use. It is not
good euchre to do this when your partner
has assisted.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Remarks.</span>&mdash;B leads the right through
the assisting hand, C plays the ace, D the

plays the queen to give information to his
partner, B should at once continue with the
eight of hearts, and thus effect a euchre.
If A plays the king, B's natural play would
be to lead the ace of clubs, whereby A and
<a name="Page_66" id="Page_66"></a><span class="pagenum" title="66"></span>C make their point. Few cases arise when
you should conceal information from your
